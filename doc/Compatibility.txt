FujiChat has so far been tested with:

Serial Interfaces:

SIO2PC + Bob-Verter driver [*]
ATR8000 serial port [*]
Atari 850 (Atari driver) [!]
Black Box [!]
P:R: Connection

[*] = hardware handshaking not supported or not tested; requires patched
slattach binary for higher baud rates; probably limited to 4800 baud.

[!] = hardware handshaking tested and working (with unpatched slattach)

DOSes:

Atari DOS 2.0S
SpartaDOS X 4.x (use 'X' command)
MyDOS 4.5

Display drivers:

XEP-80 (ABBUC driver)
CON80.SYS and CON64.SYS (Sparta X)
Omniview 80

FujiChat is known not to work with ClausB's old E80 driver, and probably
won't work with ACE-80 either (untested).

Misc:

Atari CX-85 (numeric keypad)
