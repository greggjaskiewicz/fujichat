FujiChat Command List
---------------------

[ This documentation is incomplete, but the parts that are complete
can be considered accurate ]

Being a simple client, FujiChat hasn't got many built-in commands.

Commands are shown here in UPPERCASE but can be entered in lowercase if
desired. In a few cases, there are multiple names (aliases) for the same
command; these are listed together.

-------------------------

FujiChat internal commands: these commands are handled by the client.

---
Name: /JOIN
Alias: /J
Syntax: /JOIN <channel>
Example: /JOIN ##atari

Joins an IRC channel. Since FujiChat can only handle one channel at a
time, this command only works if you're not already in a channel (use /PART
to exit the current channel).

Channel names generally start with a #, but on some networks
(e.g. FreeNode), they might start with ##.

---
Name: /PART

This command exits from the IRC channel you're currently joined to. If
you're not in a channel, you'll get a message telling you so.

---
Name: /NICK
Syntax: /NICK [<newnickname>]
Example: /NICK JoeBlow

Change your nickname, for the current session only. If you want to change
your nick permanently, use the Setup program.

With no argument, this command just shows your current nickname.

---
Name: /MSG
Alias: /M
Syntax: /MSG <user> <message>
Example: /MSG JohnSmith Hello, this is a private message!

Sends a private message to a user. When the user responds to your message,
the response will be prefixed with -> to let you know it's not channel
text. Also, if you haven't disabled it, the bell will activate.

If you're repeatedly sending/receiving private messages with the same
user, try the Tab key. It'll automatically type "/msg <user> " for you
(but unlike fancier IRC clients, it doesn't cycle between a list; only
the most recent /MSG user is remembered).

---
Name: /PING
Syntax: /PING <user>

Measure latency between yourself and another user, by sending a message
that will be echoed back to you. The round trip time is calculated with
1/10 second precision, and the result is printed like so:

> JoeBlow ping time: 1.2

---
Name: /VERSION
Alias: /VER
Syntax: /VERSION [<user>]

With no argument, this command requests the software version of the
server you're connected to. The type and format of the response varies
from network to network, but at minimum, the software's name and version
plus the server's hostname will be present.

With a user's nick as an argument, a CTCP VERSION request is sent to
the user, and the response (if any) is printed. The response usually
contains the client software name and version, and perhaps the type of
computer and/or OS the software is running on.

---
Name: /ME
Syntax: /ME <text>

This is used for "actions". Really it's just another way to send text
to a channel. Generally, the other users in the channel will see the
message formatted differently from the regular channel text. Example:
if your nick is AtariGeek and you type:

/me runs around in circles!

Other users will see something like this:

* AtariGeek runs around in circles!

Currently this can't be used with private messages: the recipient will
just see "/me does whatever" instead of the special formatting.

---
Name: /QUIT
Syntax: /QUIT [<text>]
Example: /QUIT I'm outta here

This is the correct way to disconnect from the IRC server. <text> is
optional. If provided, it's printed in the "user has quit" message that
other users see. The above example might appear as:

* AtariGeek has quit IRC [I'm outta here]

It's considered rude to just disconnect from IRC by powering off the Atari
or killing the SLIP connection. The server won't know you've disconnected
for a few minutes, and so it can't notify other users...  which means
they might keep trying to talk to you, as though you were still there.

---
Name: /BGCOLOR
Syntax: /BGCOLOR <number>

Changes the text background color. <number> is a decimal value between
0 and 255. It's a standard Atari (hue * 16 + luminance) number, like
you would POKE into a color register in BASIC.

This change won't be permanent. To permanently change the colors, use
the FujiChat Setup program.

---
Name: /FGCOLOR
Syntax: /FGCOLOR <number>

Changes the text foreground color. Remember that on the Atari, in
"Graphics 0" mode, only the luminance matters here. The hue will be taken
from the background color. Try to avoid using the same luminance for both
foreground and background (if you do, you won't be able to see the text).

---
Name: /QUOTE
Syntax: /QUOTE <literal text>

Sends a command to the IRC server, with no interpretation or handling
by FujiChat. This command usually isn't necessary: if FujiChat is given
an unknown command, it will send it to the server as-is. /QUOTE is more
useful for development and testing than for normal use.

---
Name: /CLEAR

Clears the screen. Useful if someone's being nosey, maybe.

-------------------------

IRC protocol commands: any command you enter (starting with a slash) that
FujiChat doesn't recognize, it will pass directly to the IRC server as-is.
This is a short list of commonly-user IRC commands. It's by no means a
complete list; see RFC2812 or irchelp.org for more commands.

---
Name: /TIME

Shows the server's current time. The format may vary, but usually looks
something like:

391 hitchcock.freenode.net :Wednesday March 13 2019 -- 10:08:11 +00:00

---
Name: /WHOIS
Syntax: /WHOIS <user>

Shows information about a user, including "real" name and channel(s)
they're currently chatting in.

---
Name: /WHO
Syntax: /WHO <user or channel>

Shows information about a user, or all users on the channel. Less info
is shown than a /WHOIS, but this command works on entire channels.

---
Name: /NAMES
Syntax: /NAMES [<channel>]

With a channel name, shows a list of users (nicks) in that channel.
Depending on the network and channel flags, you might only be able to
get a /NAMES list of a channel if you're actually joined to it.

With no argument, /NAMES gives a list of *every* channel and its users.
On public IRC networks, this amounts to a massive amount of data, so
you should NOT use this form of the command!

---
Name: /LUSERS

Show some user statistics for the server (number of connected users &
servers, number of IRC operators, etc).
